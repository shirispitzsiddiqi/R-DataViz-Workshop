# R-DataViz-Workshop
I delivered this workshop to my department at UC Irvine on December 4th, 2023.

This workshop made use of a longitudinal open dataset collected by Mark Brandt, Felicity M. Turner-Zwinkels, and Emily Kubin published in this [paper](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.54#3-dataset-description). The dataset is available to download at this [OSF respository](https://osf.io/3pwvb/).

To prepare the data for the workshop, I processed the yllanon.csv file through the script DatasetCleaning.R. The output of that script is the file brandt_clean.csv.
