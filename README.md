# R-DataViz-Workshop
I (Shiri Spitz Siddiqi) delivered this workshop to my department at UC Irvine on December 4th, 2023. The workshop made use of a longitudinal open dataset collected by Mark Brandt, Felicity M. Turner-Zwinkels, and Emily Kubin published in their paper:

Brandt, M. J., Turner-Zwinkels, F. M., & Kubin, E. (2021). Political Psychology Data from a 26-wave Yearlong Longitudinal Study (2019â€“2020). _Journal of Open Psychology Data, 9_(1), 2. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/jopd.54 

The dataset is available to download at this [OSF respository](https://osf.io/3pwvb/).

To prepare the data for the workshop, I processed the raw data file (yllanon.csv) through the script DatasetCleaning.R. The output of that script is the file [brandt_clean.csv](https://github.com/shirispitzsiddiqi/R-DataViz-Workshop/blob/825d49751dae84f9cc9b6ae22fcaea9da7453fd6/brandt_clean.csv).
